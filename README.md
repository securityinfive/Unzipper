# Unzipper
Unzipper is a simple python script to unzip one or a large amount of zip files. This little script came about from downloading PDF files from vendors that were all zipped, downloading ROMS, ringtones, backups where they would zip them. Got sick and tire of manually going to each one or using a ZIP tool, so I wrote this.
